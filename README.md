## 📌 Project Overview

This project delivers a complete banking analytics solution — starting from raw SQL data, moving through Excel-based cleaning, Python-based EDA, and finally a full interactive Power BI dashboard.
The goal was to analyze client behavior, loan & deposit distribution, demographic patterns, relationship insights, and overall banking performance across multiple years.

The dashboard includes Home, Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, and Summary pages with dynamic filtering and key financial KPIs.
